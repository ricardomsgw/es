### Web services definition

#### Controllers
 - [TournamentController](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_51-project/blob/tdp/backend/src/main/java/pt/ulisboa/tecnico/socialsoftware/tutor/tournament/TournamentController.java)
### Feature testing

Each subgroup member defined one reading test and one writing test. The direct links to these are:

 - [GetTournamentTest](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_51-project/blob/tdp/backend/jmeter/tournaments/WSGetTournaments.jmx)
 - [CreateTournamentTest](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_51-project/blob/tdp/backend/jmeter/tournaments/WSCreateTournament.jmx)
 - [addUserTournament](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_51-project/blob/tdp/backend/jmeter/tournaments/WSAddUser.jmx)

#### Discussion of findings

In this delivery we improved some things to achieve the good working of our controller. We also checked the operation of our program using the pattern Busy System (learned in the lectures) in JMeter. Also we test the performance of our program using new tools as profiller and Java VisualVm. Also we add a new feature "Get Tournaments" to complete the requisites.
