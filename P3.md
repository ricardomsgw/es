#### Rationale

In cypress the option to obtain the name of the component or div of the object was useful. In this way, we test the workings of our app. In the CreateTournament funcionality, the tests implemented were based in the creation of a tournament sucessfully and also in two tests we verified what happened if the user wanted create tournaments with number of questions equal zero or without select topics. In the case of the AddUser funcionality we tested the behavior of the app when a user wanted to join an opened tournament.
