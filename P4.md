### Test Features 5 and 6
How to solve the generated quiz associated with a tournament:
 - Run everything as normal, backend and frontend, fill up the database with most recent demo.sql
 - Run cypress test GenerateQuiz.js, to execute database commands (change the database credentials to your own in the file)
 - Afterwards we can join the tournament with demo-student in the frontend. And if we go to Quizzes->Available, there should be a TOURNAMENT_QUIZ which we can solve, and answer every question.
 - We can also use this method to test that demo-student can't delete this tournament because he's not the creator
 - We didnt end up having cypress commands to alter the database to delete this tournament so we could test it again, so we just delete the database and create it again and fill it with demo.sql
